## The Gates of Morning: Book 1, Chapter 1

**The Canoe Builder**

From his perch on a coral ledge, Dick scanned the southern horizon. Behind him, the ocean roared; before him, the Karolin lagoon shimmered, a vast, tranquil expanse alive with gulls. This forty-mile-wide coral atoll, his kingdom since yesterday, buzzed with activity. His people—women, children, everyone—bustled along the beach, fishing, playing, working.  The beached canoes, the empty houses that once held war canoes—all were his.

His gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed.  Turning towards the crashing waves of the northern sea, he thought of Palm Tree Island—a paradise beyond the horizon, yet a haven of savage enemies.

Little Tari, Le Taioi's son, watched him. Tari knew their men were gone, leaving the women and children vulnerable.  Then *he* arrived—in a strange boat, with Katafa, the girl lost at sea years ago. The women hailed him as a god-sent leader.

With childlike directness, Tari asked, "Taori, who are you?"

Dick couldn't fully answer. His childhood memories, his name—Dick Lestrange—were fading, swallowed by the years since his shipwreck on Palm Tree (Marua) with Kearney, the old sailor who’d raised him. Kearney was a fading ghost, a hazy memory except for the little toy ships he'd made. His true past began with Katafa's arrival.

He simply replied, "I am Taori, Tari. Why do you ask?"

Distracted by children hauling in a net, Tari forgot his question.

But Dick's mind raced. He saw the schooner burned by the Melanesians, his escape with Katafa, their arrival on this beach. He, the man chosen chief. Yet, the memory of his escape cast a shadow.

Palm Tree posed no immediate threat; its inhabitants lacked canoes. But they would build them, spot Karolin's lagoon, and come. It was inevitable. Though now a kanaka, he retained the strategic mind of a white man.  He envisioned the nearly one hundred youths reaching fighting age.  A preemptive strike? Perhaps. But underlying everything was his love for Katafa, a love constantly threatened.

A hand touched his shoulder. Katafa, a dark strand of hair escaping its vine binding, her eyes fixed on the north, whispered, "Look!"

Through a mirage, Palm Tree materialized on the horizon—a stunning island starkly contrasting with the horrific memories it held.

They stood silent, sharing the memory of their escape, the screams of the drunken Melanesians, the burning ship. The island's beauty was a deceptive mask.  They had threatened him, but threatening Katafa was everything. They would come. Their lack of women would draw them to Karolin.

Dick's world was small: the ocean, the two islands. Yet, even within this limited scope, he understood humanity's capacity for violence, greed, and destruction.

As Palm Tree faded, Katafa pointed to an approaching canoe carrying the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked towards it, ready to face what was to come.
